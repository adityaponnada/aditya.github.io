I am an interdisciplinary researcher who works at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), behavior science, and AI/ML. Broadly, I am interested in developing tools/methods to understand user behavior in natural settings and develop personalized models of behavior at scale. I work at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as their first Quantitative User Researcher to build the best understanding and models of developer experiences. I was a Research Scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/), as a member of the Human-in-the-AI (HAI) Lab. At Spotify, I built and evaluated interactive recommender systems and scalable content understanding approaches to help smaller creators (and newer content) succeed on the platform. I completed my PhD in Computer and Behavior Sciences from Khoury College of Computer Sciences and Bouve College of Health Sciences at Northeastern University, Boston, MA working with [Prof. Stephen Intille](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/intille/). As part of my PhD research, I introduced a novel experience sampling method using smartwatches to collect large-scale personalized behavioral data in real-world settings. In addition, I have built open-source tools to perform multi-level modeling and annotation on longitudinal user behavior data for pattern recognition tasks.

My research has been published in peer-reviewed venues including PACM IMWUT (UbiComp), CSCW, IUI, WebSci, CHI PLAY, IEEE PerComm, NeurIPS Workshops, Behavior Research Methods, Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Translational Behavior Medicine. In addition, my work is featured in media including [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-video-games-could-be-used-to-generate-ai-training-data/) and [Northeastern Global News](https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/09/05/northeastern-university-professor-combines-computer-science-with-health-and-measurement-with-self-reporting-to-improve-accuracy-of-fitness-tracking/).

**I am always excited about new product-oriented research opportunities.**
